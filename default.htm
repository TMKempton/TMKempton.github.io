<h3>About Me:</h3>

I'm a senior lecturer in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Manchester working in the <a 
href="https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/research/themes/analysis-geometry-and-dynamical-systems/">dynamical systems group</a>. </br></br>

My main interests lie in applications of thermodynamic formalism to problems in fractal geometry and number theory, and in particular in the study of Bernoulli convolutions and self-affine sets.
Fringe interests include percolation and the graph reconstruction conjecture. My research is partially funded by EPSRC grant <a 
href="https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/T010835/1">EP/T010835/1</a>

</br></br>

Previously I was an EPSRC funded postdoc at the University of St Andrews working with <a 
href="https://kennethfalconer.github.io/index.html">Kenneth Falconer</a> and before that I worked with <a 
href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~kraai101/">Karma Dajani</a> at the 
University of Utrecht. I completed my PhD at the University of Warwick in March 2011 under the 
supervision of <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/~masdbl/">Mark Pollicott</a>. 
My <a href="KemptonThesisFinalVersion.pdf">thesis</a> was on thermodynamic 
formalism for symbolic dynamical systems. </br></br>

I'm originally from Derby and have also lived in Coventry, Utrecht, Edinburgh, Helsinki, Thessaloniki, York and Manchester. I regularly take part in <a 
href="http://www.parkrun.org.uk/results/athleteresultshistory/?athleteNumber=82913">Parkrun</a> and am currently struggling to learn the Greek language. My wife <a 
href="https://vatt.fi/en/researcher/bizopoulou-aspasia">Aspa</a> is currently a senior researcher at the VATT Institute for Economic Research in Helsinki.

<h3>Publications and Preprints:</h3> 

Please see <a 
href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/thomas.kempton/publications">here</a> for my publications and preprints. Click <a 
href="http://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=wOstJyUAAAAJ&hl=en">here</a> for 
my Google Scholar profile.</br> 

<h3>PhD and Postdoc Opportunities:</h3> 
I'm not looking to take on any more PhD students or postdocs at the moment, but please feel free to get in touch and I may be able to direct you towards colleagues in the dynamics group.
<br><br>

I currently mentor two postdocs, <a href="https://lawrence-d-lee.github.io/">Lawrence Lee</a> is an EPSRC Doctoral Prize Fellow and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/leticiapardosimon/home">Leticia Pardo Simon</a> is the Manchester Mathematics Fellow. 

My PhD student Alexandros Batsis successfully defended his thesis in November 2021. I previously mentored <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/demi-allen-mathematics">Demi Allen</a> for a one year doctoral prize fellowship at Manchester, Demi went on to hold postdoc positions at the Heilbronn institute and at Warwick before starting a lectureship at Exeter.

<h3>Teaching:</h3> 
I teach Metric Spaces and Fractal Geometry, both of which take place during the Spring semester. Full course information can be found on blackboard.


<h3>Outreach and Public Engagement:</h3>
I used to run <a 
href="https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/mathsbombe/">Mathsbombe</a>, an online maths competition aimed primarily at students up to Year 13 (England and Wales), S6 (Scotland), Year 14 (Northern Ireland). You can find questions that I have written <a 
href="https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/mathsbombe_2019/problem.php?index=2">here</a>, <a 
href="https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/mathsbombe_2019/problem.php?index=5">here</a>, <a 
href="https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/mathsbombe_2020/problem.php?index=1">here</a>, <a 
href="https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/mathsbombe_2020/problem.php?index=3">here</a>, <a 
href="https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/mathsbombe_2020/problem.php?index=5">here</a> and <a 
href="https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/mathsbombe_2020/problem.php?index=7">here</a>.

I also take part in <a 
href="https://www.mub.eps.manchester.ac.uk/sciencex/">Science X</a> and the <a 
href="https://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/cryptography_competition/ATCD.php">Alan Turing Cryptography Day</a>. 



<h3>Conference and Meeting Organisation:</h3> 
Together with <a href="https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matmj/">Thomas Jordan</a> and <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/mph204">Mark Holland</a> I organise the UK <a 
href="https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matmj/ergodicmeetings2021.html">One Day Ergodic Theory Meetings</a>, funded by an LMS Scheme 3 grant. We also run a mailing list with announcements relevant to UK ergodic theory (including links for the online meetings) <a href="https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=UKETDS">here</a>.<br><br>

Together with <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/coles/">Solly Coles</a>, <a href="https://nataliajurga.wordpress.com/">Natalia Jurga</a> and <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/rhiannon-dougall/">Rhiannon Dougall</a> I organised a <a href="https://www.icms.org.uk/events/workshops/JET21">winter school</a> in ergodic theory at ICMS. <br><br> 

Together with <a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/xiong.jin/">Xiong Jin</a> and <a href="http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jmf32/">Jon Fraser</a> I organised a fractals conference at <a 
href="https://www.icms.org.uk/">ICMS</a> Edinburgh. <br><br>
